# Predicting High-Value Customer Churn: A Data-Driven Approach

====================================================================================

## Problem Statement

As a data analyst for a leading telecommunications provider, our goal is to identify high-value customers at risk of churn using machine learning models and provide actionable recommendations to minimize lost revenue.

**Context**

The telecom industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid technological advancements, and constantly shifting customer preferences. In this dynamic environment, retaining valuable customers is crucial for maintaining revenue and market share. However, predicting which customers are most likely to churn and taking proactive measures to retain them is a significant challenge.

**Data Description**

We have access to a comprehensive dataset containing information about 100,000 customers, including:

1. **Customer demographics**: Age, gender, occupation, education level, and income.
2. **Usage patterns**: Total incoming and outgoing minutes, data usage (MB), and the number of recharges.
3. **Churn status**: A binary variable indicating whether the customer has churned or not.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

We track the following KPIs to measure the success of our churn prediction model:

1. **Recall**: The proportion of actual churning customers correctly predicted by the model.
2. **Precision**: The proportion of predicted churning customers that actually churned.
3. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both.

### Business Objectives

Our primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts which high-value customers are most likely to churn, enabling us to take proactive measures to retain them and minimize lost revenue.

Secondary objectives include:

1. **Maximizing customer retention**: Minimize the number of high-value customers who actually churn.
2. **Optimizing resource allocation**: Focus on the most effective retention strategies for high-value customers.
3. **Improving overall customer satisfaction**: Enhance the overall customer experience by addressing issues promptly and providing personalized support.

**Challenge**

The challenge lies in developing a model that effectively captures the complex relationships between customer demographics, usage patterns, and churn status while balancing recall, precision, and F1 Score. Additionally, we must consider the business objectives of maximizing customer retention, optimizing resource allocation, and improving overall customer satisfaction.

**Solution**

We will leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that identifies high-value customers at risk of churn. Our approach will involve:

1. **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering the dataset.
2. **Model selection**: Evaluating various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and selecting the best-performing one based on KPIs.
3. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Fine-tuning model hyperparameters to optimize performance.
4. **Deployment**: Integrating the trained model into a production-ready framework for real-time predictions.


**Impact**

By developing an accurate churn prediction model, we can:

1. **Reduce lost revenue**: Minimize the financial impact of customer churn by taking proactive measures to retain high-value customers.
2. **Improve customer satisfaction**: Enhance the overall customer experience by addressing issues promptly and providing personalized support.
3. **Optimize resource allocation**: Focus on the most effective retention strategies for high-value customers, maximizing resource utilization.

## Model Selection and Evaluation
We evaluated various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (Vanilla), Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning, Ensemble Models with Hyperparameter Tuning, and Random Forest with Boosting (Gradient Boosting Classifier). The recommended model is the Random Forest with Boosting, which achieved a high recall of 0.693989 and an F1 Score of 0.58.

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1\_Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Baseline Model | 0.918676 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 |
| Logistic Regression Model \(Vanilla\) | 0.373736 | 0.108789 | 0.931694 | 0.194829 |
| Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV | 0.404511 | 0.110700 | 0.898907 | 0.197124 |
| Decision Tree \(Vanilla\) | 0.886346 | 0.369973 | 0.565574 | 0.447326 |
| Decision Tree with Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV | 0.890679 | 0.393761 | 0.637978 | 0.486966 |
| Random Forest with Boosting \(Gradient Boosting Classifier\) | 0.919009 | 0.501481 | 0.693989 | 0.582235 |
| Ensemble Models with Hyperparameter Tuning | 0.922231 | 0.517660 | 0.640710 | 0.572650 |


## Business Recommendations
To minimize churn among high-value customers, we recommend the following strategies:

1. **Monitor Usage Patterns and Offer Personalized Plans**: Analyze total incoming and outgoing minutes to identify declining usage patterns. Proactively engage with customers through personalized offers, discounts, or tailored plans that better suit their needs.
2. **Leverage Strong Correlation Between 2G & 3G Revenues to Create Bundled Offers**: Develop bundled data plans that include both 2G and 3G services. Target users who frequently recharge 2G services with incentives for upgrading to 3G, increasing overall data usage and revenue.
3. **Address Decline in Data Usage, Especially for 2G, with Targeted Campaigns**: Migrate 2G users to 3G through targeted campaigns offering incentives such as free 3G service trials or discounts on 3G data packs. Educate customers about the advantages of 3G over 2G.
4. **Focus on Increasing Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) by Enhancing Call and Data Plans**: Introduce promotional offers like discounted call rates during off-peak hours or bonus data packs to encourage higher usage. Monitor and promote recharges through targeted marketing efforts to stabilize ARPU.
5. **Identify High-Risk Customers Early and Implement Retention Strategies**: Flag customers with significant behavior changes from the 'good' phase to the 'action' phase. Offer targeted interventions, such as personalized communication, loyalty programs, or special retention offers, to prevent churn.
6. **Optimize Roaming and Night Pack Offers to Prevent Revenue Loss**: Develop competitive roaming plans and revamped night pack offers with attractive pricing or additional benefits to encourage customers to continue using these services.
7. **Improve Customer Service Quality and Address Issues Promptly**: Enhance customer satisfaction by improving the quality of customer support and addressing issues promptly.
8. **Implement Loyalty Programs and Reward High-Value Customers**: Offer loyalty rewards, exclusive deals, or priority customer service to high-value customers, encouraging continued loyalty.

By implementing these strategies, we can effectively target high-risk customers, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately reduce churn rates, minimizing lost revenue for the telecom company.
